# Chat with PDFs

Chat with PDFs is a web application that allows users to upload PDF documents, extract and process their contents, and interact with the documents via a chat interface. The application leverages Google Cloud Storage for storing PDFs, PostgreSQL for metadata and embeddings storage, and a custom LLM API for generating responses based on document contents.

## Overview

This project provides a seamless way to manage and interact with PDF documents. Users can upload documents, which are then processed in the background to extract text and generate embeddings. The documents and their metadata are stored in Google Cloud Storage and PostgreSQL, respectively. A chat interface allows users to query the documents and receive responses generated by an LLM API.
